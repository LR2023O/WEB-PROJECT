                <b>Kenya's infrastructure</b> is a key part of the country's economic growth, and includes transportation, energy, water, and telecommunications: <br>
                
                <br><b style="font-size: large">Transportation:</b> Kenya's transportation network is extensive, but uneven, and is considered superior to its neighbors. Nairobi is the largest city between Cairo and Johannesburg, and the Port of Mombasa is a major gateway for the region. <br>

                <br><b style="font-size: large">Cell signals:</b> Cell signals: Over 90% of Kenya's population has access to GSM cell signals. <br> 
                <br><b style="font-size: large">Air transport:</b> Kenya has a successful public-private partnership in air transport. <br>
                <img src="img/trans1.jpg" alt=""> 
                <br><b style="font-size: large">Infrastructure networks:</b> Kenya's infrastructure networks are largely isolated from those of its neighboring countries. Road connections with Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Somalia are of very low quality. <br>
                <br> <b style="font-size: large">Infrastructure sector:</b> The infrastructure sector is key to Kenya's economic growth, as articulated in the country's Vision 2030. <br>
                 
                <br><b style="font-size: large">State Department of Infrastructure (SDol):</b> The SDol is one of five functional state departments under the Ministry of Transport, Infrastructure, Housing, Urban Development, and Public Works.
